    <h2>By: Sebastian</h2>
    <p>I started coding when I saw choobs.repl.co and decided I could do better. So thanks to them.  Anyway my goal to become better than choobs motivated me forward to success.  Some really, really, helpful sites were as followed, <a href="https://w3schools.com" target="_blank">w3schools,</a> <a href="https://youtube.com" target="_blank">Youtube,</a> <a href="https://view-source:" target="_blank">View source (for examples),</a><a href="https://replit.com" target="_blank">Replit (for code editing),</a> and finialy, <a href="https://thomaswilburn.net/caret/" target="_blank">Caret text/code editor.</a>  And most of all thank you to the utterly<sup>1</sup> clueless tech department who did absouluty nothing towards stopping me.</p>
